Anyone who's been at the start line of an trail/ultra race would be well aware that the participants are overwhelmingly white and male. This is something that has been identified more formally in a survey conducted by the University of Central Lancashire (https://www.trailultraproject.com/survey) which aimed to look at the culture and habits of trail & ultra runners in the UK and US. Over 95% of the 1,000 respondents described their ethnicity as 'white', while 40% identified as female. The percentage of female respondents to the survey doesn't directly correspond to the gender differences in the results of ultramarathons as obtained from the [D.U.V](http://statistik.d-u-v.org/), consolidated on Kaggle in the [dataset of ultra marathon running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running); with the differences likely due to the US and UK generally having a far better gender balance to other nations. One other thing to note is that the dataset only contains finishers, and any disproportional DNF's between male and female would impact the overall participation numbers.

On the positive side, the survey shows Courtney Dauwalter and Jasmin Paris as the two most inspirational athletes for the US and UK respectively, 

## Current trends

### Participation rates

The dataset, containing finishers of races longer than 45km, shows how ultramarathons have been gaining in popularity in recent years; both in terms of the number of participants putting themselves through such events and also the number of events that are being put on. 2022 saw a total of 467,000 participants finish a total of 6,500 events worldwide, down from a high of 722,000 finishers in 2019 (pre-Covid), but still trending up.

```

The sport has historically been overwhelmingly male-dominated, with the data indicating that gender distribution is shifting alongside the growing popularity of taking part in ultramarathons. However the percentage of female finishers in 2022 was just 23% globally, as opposed to 40% of the survey respondents mentioned in the introduction. The chart shows a few different trend changes, with a gradual increase of participation rate of 0.2% per year until 1986, accelerating to 0.8% until 1998 with current trends seeing an approximate 0.3% per year increase in the female/male ratio of participants.

The bad news is that it'll take another 90 years to achieve a 50/50 female/male distribution globally with current trends.

Some countries are far ahead of the curve for gender distribution than others. Races in USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand tend to have the highest female representation; whereas Spain, France, India and Turkey are amongst the lowest, albeit with fewer races taking place in India and Turkey. This is shown below by year, after looking at countries that have had more than 2 races in the given year in the dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

```

A closer look at a few of the major countries shows how Spain and France consistently have far worse gender divide than other nations, but it also appears to be a gap which is growing. It's tough to know the cause of the glaring differences between races in different countries, whether this is due to cultural issues or accessibility in these countries or something else.
